# AddingCPU

This repository contains a complete replication of the AddingCPU example as presented in Zainalabedin Navabi's textbook Verilog Digital System Design. The project demonstrates a classic register-transfer level (RTL) CPU design, including datapath and controller modules, and provides a step-by-step testbench for simulation and verification.

Changes:

- Gated clock (power optimization)
- Added IDLE state to controller FSM
- Added stepped execution
- Added asm2hex.py - Converts "assembly" to hex file
